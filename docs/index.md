For the latest version of Sonic World DX, download here:
You will need to download 1.2.4 first, then patch it with 1.2.7 files.
1.2.7's patch is important as it fixes various mod-related issues.

Mirrors are provided for the former.

## Installing the Game

To install the hotpatch:

- Download Sonic World DX 1.2.4.
- Extract Sonic World DX 1.2.4
- Download the 1.2.7 Hotpatch.
- Drag all of the hotpatch contents into the same folder you extracted 1.2.4 into
    - If you are prompted to replace files, select yes.
    - If you are not prompted, you put the hotpatch files into the wrong place.
- Start the game!
- Go through the First Time menu (setting your settings presets and control style)
    - You can change these later in more detail using the in-game Options menu or `SETTINGS.xml`

## Enabling Mods

In current versions of the game, mods are enabled by default. They can be disabled in the `Gameplay` section of the Options menu.

Sonic World DX will generate a `Mods` folder on first launch. The game comes with one by default: Classic Sonic!

If you see Classic Sonic on the second page of the Character Select screen, mods are enabled.

Along with Classic Sonic, you will also see a `mods.xml`. There is a whole section for this that is a recommended read if you want more control over mods.

## Downloading Mods

Sonic World DX has hundreds of mods that work out-of-the-box with the game. Most of the Character and Stage mods work with no configuration needed.

### Installation

1. Download the mod
2. Extract the mod into the game's Mod folder.
3. Open the game.

Yes, it's that easy. If you have any trouble, more intricate details are available in the mod category's specific sections.
